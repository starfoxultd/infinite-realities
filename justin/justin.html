    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

        In “No.1 (Reap the Sown),” the inaugural piece of an envisioned series, I delve into a narrative where nature reclaims man-made environments, set within a fictional world reminiscent of the 1980s. This terrarium, a microcosm of conflict and consequence, serves as the genesis of a broader exploration into alternate realities and histories.

	The heart of this piece lies in the story of “BigGro,” a fictional company symbolic of unchecked industrial ambition. Through vintage-inspired advertisements, echoing the deceptive marketing of products like cigarettes, BigGro’s narrative unfolds — promoting an unregulated fertilizer akin to the environmental hazards of CFCs. These ads, juxtaposed with the encroaching natural elements, form a commentary on the optimistic yet destructive industrial practices of the past.

	Further depth is added through various written elements: a poignant letter from a farmer caught in the midst of environmental change, ominous government warnings, and more advertisements, each contributing to the narrative of a society on the brink of collapse.

		</p>
		<p>
        Each element within the terrarium is meticulously chosen to convey a sense of containment and preservation — snapshots from a world at a pivotal moment. This sense of captivity is not just physical but also temporal, as if these scenes are echoes from a parallel past, warning of a possible future.

	“No.1 (Reap the Sown)” is more than a standalone piece; it is the beginning of a journey into multiple universes where similar themes of environmental reclamation, corporate irresponsibility, and societal reflection are explored. Through this series, I aim to not only showcase the resilience of nature but also to provoke thought about our role in shaping and, in turn, being shaped by our environment.

	As the first installment in a potential series, this work sets the stage for a diverse exploration of worlds, each with their own stories, challenges, and lessons, inviting the viewer to ponder not just the world within the terrarium, but the worlds that may yet come to be.

      <!-- Scrolling interview text goes here -->
      <p>Emily Lai: I ask you a couple of questions about you. Oh, yeah.
Okay, so first one, How has working at Binghamton influenced your own personal practice?
		</p>
		
<p>Christopher Swift: So, for me, this has been a big career shift. So I was a practicing graphic designer, prior to coming to Binghamton, so I’ve been a lecturer and an adjunct professor at various schools in America and Canada, but primarily my main focus was on professional studio based design. So the transition for me to Bingham ton has been one where I’m able to actually focus very heavily on my research and move away from a client based work so the big change really for me coming to Binghamton has been an ability to focus on different forms of making different experimentation and research.
		</p>
	<p>
	EL: Okay, cool. So you says like, it’s like allowed you to be more creative.
		</p>
<p>
	CS: Time and space to explore and spend time with these ideas and normally, because I was in a situation where clients were paying for my time tabbing time that isn’t paid for doctrine confused, seemed like a waste. If I could be your client work done. So this allows me to kind of make space to focus on these other things I’ve been thinking about for decades.
		</p>
<p>
		EL: Okay, cool. Um, so where do you find inspiration?
	</p>
<p>
	EL: How has your style changed over time?
		</p>
<p>
		CS: So when I first started to design, I wasn’t very confident as a maker so I became very rules focused and obsessed with the kind of the parts of graphic design that have what seemed like yes and no answers. And then my, what has changed is my recognition that tried to control these outputs is ridiculous... not be concerned with a failure or things being wrong and recognize that even wrong things are incredibly valuable.
		</p>
<p>
		EL: How does the space around you influence what you do?
		</p>
<p>
		CS:  So that’s interesting. So I was on a farm, big farm countries. And so I really enjoy my mornings, like the days where I come to teach I always find interesting where we come at six and I go and I will go make a fire in our wood burning stove.
		</p>
<p>
	EL: Okay, last question. I’ve always been curious about this, like, how have you been able to I know you use like aI a lot in your work. Like how have you been able to like, embrace that instead of being fearful of it? Yeah.

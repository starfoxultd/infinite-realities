    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

      <p>
        I came into my freshman year at Binghamton University as a mechanical engineering and physics major, loving art but not confident enough to pursue it in college. For the next year I bounced between majors, deep down knowing I wanted to major in art, but feeling like it would be a waste of time and that I wouldn’t get a job after school. One day, my freshman year suitemates invited me to their room to play a video game called The Last of Us (TLOU).
		</p>
		<p>
I had no idea that video games could tell such an incredible story. After spending a couple weeks with my roommates watching them play TLOU, I was in awe at the graphics, the characters, the story, and specifically, the environment. Right after finishing the game, the three of us were all sitting in their bedroom, talking about the game and the story while the credits were rolling. I wasn’t really paying attention to what my roommates were saying and just mindlessly watched the credits go by, until one caught my eye: Environment Artist. It was then that I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life: I wanted to be a part of a team that makes video games.	
		</p>
		<p>
         For my project, I knew I wanted to create environmental art. One game that I found was Rain World. This smaller indie game has beautiful environments unlike any I have ever seen. After taking a winter course where we examined storytelling methods used in video games, one that stood out the most for me was “environmental storytelling,” which is a technique used in video games where the environment gives the player context and details about the story without the use of dialogue or thoughts between the characters.
		</p>
		<p>
For my project, I created four separate digital paintings of environments inspired by Rain World, focusing on a theme of humanity vs technology and the negative effects that technology has on our environment, which is also a theme explored in Rain World. To add more interest, I also wanted to create animations such as light rays and moving clouds to bring life to the worlds that I was creating. I had never used Procreate until now, so there was a bit of a learning curve I had to go through to learn digital painting techniques, as well as After Effects for the animations.

		  Addy Phoenix: What do you do in your personal work?
		</p>
		
<p>
	Alisha Brunelli: I work as an artist as well as a commercial designer. I consider my work for exhibition my personal work, in that I am not negotiating boundaries with a client, but rather solely for my research and interests. As a multidisciplinary artist, I work with a variety of media (primarily drawing, painting, mixed media) that explores topics that can mostly be categorized as ‘where science meets spirituality’. Often I take up topics that explore ways of ‘making the invisible, somehow visible’ - the invisible aspects of ourselves and our world, our experience, and finding ways of expressing them visually. It is a very intuitive process, and often evolves out of my practice of reading, writing, maintaining a sketchbook, and meditation. I wish to make work that makes people feel a larger connection, to contemplate our connections to nature, to move toward wellness, affirmation, belonging, self discovery.

	AP: How have you liked working at Binghamton University, and how has it influenced your personal life?
		</p>
<p>
	AB: I’ve been teaching at BU since Spring 2015, (and 22 years in total coming from other teaching environments) and the practice of teaching art (drawing, design, etc) is constantly feeding my personal creative practice. I enjoy planning curriculum - problems and situations for students to explore, and honestly these are oftentimes related to my own curiosities with the world and with materials. We are really exploring together. My students create solutions and explorations that are always keeping me invigorated. I really enjoy the rhythm of the fall and spring semesters. My colleagues are curious and smart - and they make great work that inspires me - there is a synergy to this environment
		</p>
<p>
		AP: What and/or who inspires you?
	</p>
<p>
	AB: I am inspired by what I read (topics ranging from quantum physics, neuroscience, to subtle energy systems found in both humans and nature, to depth psychology, to new ecological research, paradigm shifts in systems, transcendence). I like the spaces between and behind the mainstream information that we’re fed in our modern culture, and people that ask new and better questions. I am inspired by mindful consumption. I am also inspired by nature, and my time in nature. 
		</p>
<p>
		AP: What motivates you to continue to make art?
		</p>
<p>
		AB: I can honestly say that I always knew I would be a person in the world making things, this comes from a mysterious place inside of me and it fully motivates me. I have a feeling I’ve been doing this for many many lives.
		</p>
<p>
		AP: What is the biggest source of growth in your work?
		</p>
<p>
	AB: The biggest source of growth in my work is getting positive feedback from a variety of places - people I care about, people I respect, and artists. When another artist I respect responds positively to my work, it is a big boost for me. I really enjoy conversing about my work, and the work of others.

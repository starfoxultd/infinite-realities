    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

      <p>
        	“Projection and Reflection” is an exploration of the fragmented self, a visual dialogue between what is seen and what is hidden within the depths of our emotions. In this piece, I use a shattered mirror as the canvas, with each shard bearing an image that captures a different facet of my emotional spectrum. The diversity in these emotions—from joy to despair, serenity to turmoil—mirrors the complexity of human experience.

		</p>
		<p>
        	The placement of the display light is a deliberate choice, casting reflections that extend beyond the physical boundaries of the mirror onto the walls of the gallery. This interplay of light and shadow symbolizes how our innermost feelings can project outward, influencing our environment and the people around us. The reflections on the wall, ever-changing with the viewer’s perspective, invite an interactive experience. They are not just reflections of light, but of the soul—fragmented, yet whole in their collective portrayal.
		 
		</p>
		<p>
		As an artist new to the exhibition scene, “Projection and Reflection” represents my journey into the world of expressive, conceptual art. It is a declaration of my willingness to dismantle the barriers between my internal states and public expression. This piece is an invitation to viewers to contemplate the multifaceted nature of their own emotions, as seen through the lens of my own experiences. Through this work, I hope to encourage a deeper understanding and acceptance of the diverse emotional states that define the human condition.

    <h2>PROFESSOR INTERVIEW</h2>
    <div class="interview-text" id="scrollingText">
      <!-- Scrolling interview text goes here -->
      <p>Mara Warford: At what age did you like become interested in photography and like what sparked that interest?

		</p>
		
<p>Kari Varner: I fortunately, had a really wonderfully you know, supported and supportive photography department, in my high school, and several high school instructors, that were really kind of integral to my growth because I was able to do not only just getting a good foundation in Digital Photography, digital imaging, I think is what they called it. I suppose that I really started spending time in the darkroom and then didn’t really stop. I should mention to my mom is an art teacher. So she taught elementary and middle school for about 40 years.
		</p>
	<p>
	MW: When did you decide or know that photography was like your passion? That’s what you wanted to pursue? That’s what you want to do professionally? And it was just like, that’s what you’re doing.
		</p>
<p>
	KV: Um, well, let’s see. I might sort of segment things out when responding because I did my undergraduate degree in new media arts. And, you know, it was my attempt to do something more practical. But I just found that I continued to gravitate towards photography and towards fine art. And so I found a way to kind of merge those interest and in the building of my practice, but, you know, I never really considered myself to be a photographer, necessarily, but more so an artist that utilizes photography. Because I, you know, I work with images as a form of language.
		</p>
<p>
		MW: So would you consider yourself to be a photographer then like, is that how you would describe yourself or what would you say?
	</p>
<p>
	KV: I would say and artists that uses photography, if I had to, you know if I absolutely had to categorize then then yes, that would be the most kind of natural fit, but I think in terms of like, just image as language like it feels oftentimes that you know, I want to kind of push against that. The sort of like parameters that are often placed around photography.
		</p>
<p>
		MW: Is there a common subject or theme that you prefer to like photograph?
		</p>
<p>
		KV: I was gonna characterize the style is just like, convoluted and heavily researched based. Okay. I’m trying to utilize processes often that I don’t like I have to learn a process for the making of the work. Okay, let me enjoy that. But sometimes there’s also like the desire to make something that’s a little bit more approachable and fluid and straightforward.
		</p>
<p>
		KV: I think that’s what everyone strives for students and faculty and staff alike is to provide that kind of environment especially because you know, we have the students that are majors and minors, and obviously that’s very tight knit, but then there’s a lot of students that are just dropping in to try out a class and of course, you want it to be a welcoming environment for them to instead of trying to like, scare them away into thinking that they can’t you know, be an artist or art into their life. Because for many, they’ll take one art class in college, and then that might be Yeah. And the hope is that it’s something they continue to engage with.

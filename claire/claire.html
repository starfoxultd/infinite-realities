    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

        This semester I created a video project based on reflections of the changing world around me. The video is a compilation of footage gathered from my daily life– the road work outside my house, the nature preserve, the dance studio, and my bedroom. The audio of the project is an improv original song, where I sing and play the guitar. In the song I sing about “the body of the beast”, which I see as the capitalist, patriarchal, racist, and oppressive underpinnings of the United States. I’ve thought a lot about the expression of “the beast” as it relates to my experiences bearing witness to the impacts of climate change and the experience of sexual trauma. Our personal experiences are almost always connected to a larger story, a story that for many of us contains cycles of abuse and resilience within oppressive systems. In this project I am interested in approaching how those systems have affected me emotionally and how to challenge them. 
		</p>
		<p>
         The opening lyrics are: “We’ll play pretend/until we lose our shit” – these lyrics are meant to point out how we ignore or cover up injustices and environmental realities until we cannot afford to anymore–i.e. we “lose our shit”. We will pretend things are okay until we can’t pretend anymore. 
		</p>
		<p>
	The video starts with shaky footage of road work outside, with harsh noises and men talking. The machinery to me symbolizes this “beast”. Then it jumps to the nature preserve at dusk, and you can hear bits of conversation between me and a friend. The contrast between machinery and nature was important to me in order to showcase how these two different things oppose each other. I wanted to communicate a feeling of nostalgia in the nature preserve shots, because it often feels that these spaces are disappearing.
		</p>
		<p>
	Some of the last shots are of me in my bedroom staring down the camera. I wanted these shots to represent the eyes of a person who is trying to both critically witness and dynamically engage in the world around her. I wanted the viewer to feel witnessed. To me, the eye contact is almost like a challenge– to myself and others–  to listen, change, and bear witness to this beast around and inside us.

    <h2>PROFESSOR INTERVIEW</h2>

      <!-- Scrolling interview text goes here -->
      <p>When I interviewed Sarah Nance I learned more about her projects in the art world. Sarah is an multidisciplinary artist based mostly in installation and fiber. She explores “entanglements of geologic processes and human experience in archived, constructed, and speculative terrains.” When I spoke to her, Sarah shared some of her projects done in her hometown in which she used the land as a map for a textile project. We also spoke about her interest in shrouds, exemplified in her work “shrouds for an ancient sea”-- in this project she created star shaped shrouds based on the geographic makeup of the land. I remember asking her why she became an artist, and she explained that it was because as an artist she could integrate all of her interests into one practice. Sarah has a strong interest in geography that she has been able to explore via her art. A couple summers ago, Sarah had the chance to work with scientists at NASA with their work. She assisted in collecting geological datasets and then used that data to create textile patterns. Personally, I feel that interdisciplinary communication and collaboration is an important direction for academia to head into, and I found this to be such an interesting example of those possible collaborations. I felt that Sarah was an innovator in her field.

In addition to talking about Sarah's work, I also ended up sharing some of my work as well. Although I could not get the video for my Visual Narrative to load, I did share some of my own base interests that inspired my final piece. That semester, I had the opportunity to perform an original improv dance performance based on personal experiences. I showed Sarah the whole video, and we spoke about improv as an art form and method for creating. Sarah shared that being able to work improvisationally was something that she wanted to improve on. I felt this was interesting because personally I struggle to work in more structured ways. In the end it was really interesting to speak to a professor who works in such different ways than I do, and I greatly appreciated the perspective I got from her.

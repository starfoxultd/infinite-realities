    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

        I wanted to introduce you guys to this super cool YouTuber called IMALIVE! I was a big fan of her when she was still streaming on Twitch, but recently, all of her uploads have completely disappeared. I was really sad about this, but luckily, I found some clips from her videos on the Wayback Machine, so I was able to upload them onto YouTube for you all to see!

         Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like there’s something off about these clips… I don’t remember them being this way when I first watched them. I’m going to keep looking for more clips, I think there was something really special about her. Wherever you are, Ima, I’ll keep an eye out for you!

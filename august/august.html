    	<p>	"Infinite Realities: Experiments in Time, Material, and Motion" is a dynamic pop-up exhibition that explores the fleeting yet impactful intersection of art and innovation. Featuring a compelling collection from multiple academic classes, with a special focus on the Visual Narrative class, this exhibition presents a diverse range of artworks that challenge and expand our understanding of artistic boundaries.</p>

		<p>	As a temporary showcase with a limited run, this exhibition creates an urgent and vibrant platform for artistic expressions that are as ephemeral as they are profound. Through a series of engaging pieces, the exhibition explores complex themes such as the interplay between reality and perception, the manipulation of time and space, and the role of movement and material in shaping artistic dialogue.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in a curated environment where each piece contributes to a broader narrative exploring the infinite possibilities of creative expression. This exhibition not only highlights the talents and insights of its contributors but also encourages viewers to contemplate the myriad ways in which art intersects with and influences our daily lives.</p>

        With the pieces “Have a Day” and “Uncomfort to Comfort” I created a narrative surrounding everyday experiences of the LGBTQ+ community more specifically non-binary individuals. This narrative is one that I believe that can be continued throughout my artistic career and through different mediums. The next step for the narrative is to create a solid background for the cardboard head character, which

         I affectionately call “Mx.Head”. I want the audience to believe that anyone could be wearing the head, more specifically any trans person. I would try to find a wide variety of trans individuals and have a photo shot with them all in the cardboard head and without. I would then photoshop each individual person with a lower opacity layer of the mask. With the manipulated photos I would place them in a grid pattern and make a CMYK screen print of the photos.
